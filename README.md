# ArduinoProjects
A collection of personal Arduino projects, all the way from elementary school to now.

These are all of the Arduino projects that I have saved on my desktop currently, which I have been collecting for a long time now.

A word of reminder, these are all personal projects, I probably swear a little in some of them and used a non descriptive title in a few others. Regardless, they are here as a backup for me and as as a curiosity for anyone else who wants to look through them.
